# Dataset-SMTSP-SFS

This repository provides benchmark datasets used in the study "Minimizing Total Tardiness for the Single Machine Scheduling Problem with Sequence-Dependent Family Setup Times via Deep Reinforcement Learning." These datasets are specifically designed to evaluate algorithms for solving single machine scheduling problems while minimizing total tardiness, considering sequence-dependent family setup times.

## Problem Instance: Instance number
Number of jobs: Number of jobs in the instance
Number of families: Number of job families
Tau (Ï„): Due date-related parameter
R: Due date-related parameter
Processing times: Array of processing times for each job
Due dates: Array of due dates for each job
Setup times: Matrix of setup times between jobs from different families
Families: Array indicating the family each job belongs to

# Example File Description:
Processing times: Time taken to complete each job. For example, [55, 120, 481, 100, 416, 403, 135, 55, 70, 160] represents 10 jobs with varying processing times.
Due dates: The deadlines for each job. For example, [829, 1317, 1300, 995, 1345, 533, 728, 1084, 1104, 1136] represents the due dates for the 10 jobs.
Setup times: A 2D array representing the setup times between jobs from different families. For example, [[0, 61], [60, 0]] indicates different setup times between two families.
Families: The family to which each job belongs. For example, [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] shows that 10 jobs belong to two different families (0 or 1).

# Usage Instructions
Use these instance files to evaluate the performance of various scheduling algorithms.
Design scheduling algorithms that minimize tardiness by considering job due dates and family-dependent setup times.
